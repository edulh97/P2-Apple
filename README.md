# Project 2 - "Apple"

This second part of the "Apple" project is based on improving on the first instalment, adding another page and more functionalities with the same theme (in this case a payment gateway).
This new page has been designed with bootstrap implementation and new functions have been added with JavaScrip that allow adding, modifying and deleting data. 

The original model was taken from this page: https://dribbble.com/shots/22859972-Website-Apple-Store
